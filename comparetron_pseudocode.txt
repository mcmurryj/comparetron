### IF INPUT IS GB FILE, UNPACK TO FASTA; OTHERWISE ADD INDEX  ###
For synteny analysis it will be necessary to have some sort of index value in the FASTA header.
Also, for separate contigs, it will be necessary to do SOMETHING to the index to avoid cross-contig artifacts.

### MAKE BLAST/DIAMOND INDICES ###

### RUN BLAST/DIAMOND SEARCHES ###

### PARSE BLAST/DIAMOND RESULTS TO OBTAIN BEST BILATERAL HITS WITH BIT SCORES ###

### RE-PARSE RESULTS TO OBTAIN SYNTENY SCORES ###
Options for synteny assessment:
1) geometric distance
based on nucleotide positions.  Count # of BBH within X units on a 2D plot.
For genome in genomes:
   make dataframe: reference ID, x, y, contig
   For hit in hits:
      x is the position of the reference protein (average start/stop position)
      y is the position of the hit
   For point in the dataframe:
      count the # of other points within 20,000 arbitrary units and the same contig.
      record that number in the hit_dict

2) Adjacency
Make network.  For protein with BBH, make node.  If index of BBH is within 2 of index of previous 2 BBH-es, add edge

### PRINT RESULT TABLES ###
Verbose or regular.

### INTERACTIVE RESULTS ###
Plot ingroup genome #1 on X axis, ingroup genome #2 on Y axis, color points to indicate homology scores.
Show protein ID and annotation with mouseover.
