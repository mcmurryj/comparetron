## comparetron

#### Description

The comparetron is a special-purpose tool for the comparison of multiple microbial genomes.  This tool is useful in cases where at least two species are known to have a particular molecular phenotype of unknown genetic origin.  For example, they produce a natural product with unknown biosynthesis.  

#### Usage
*comparetron -ingroup_folder -outgroup_folder*

#### Input
*ingroup_folder* is a folder containing genbank files corresponding to organisms that possess the phenotype of interest.  

*outgroup_folder* is a folder containing genbank files corresponding to related organisms that do not possess the phenotype.

#### Output

#### Example

### TODO:
- Decide how to handle genes occurring on different contigs.
- Finish plotting function.
- Put together test dataset.
- Switch to DIAMOND for performance?
